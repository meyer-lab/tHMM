It is beneficial to understand how the `CellVar` class is designed to create objects that store a `state`, its relationships (`left`, `right`, `parent`) to other cells, and its multivariate observations (`obs`). When cells are created via the `member` function, their familiar relationships are automatically assigned. The two daughters are assigned to `left` and `right` and for the daughters, the parent is assigned to `parent`. Other familiar relationships can be accessed through other member variables and functions. Note that the first generation is empty (we can see this because the `parent_cell` is instantiated with `parent=None` and with `gen=1` which means that `gen=0` of the lineage contains nothing except `None`). As such, indexing for generations of lineages starts at `1`.

The first observation in the observation list for each cell is a Bernoulli observation which can either be 1 or 0. An observatioon of 1 implies that the cell lived. An observation of 0 implies that the cell died. The second observation in the observation is the gamma observation and represents the lifetime of the cell.

    "Let's see how well our model estimated the parameters that created this lineage. Recall that the model is BLIND to the true states of the cells (unlike the code blocks above where we knew the identity of the cells (in terms of their state)). This model primarily has to segment or partition the tree and its cells into the number of states we think is present in our data, and then identify the parameters that describe each state's distributions. We can not only check how well it estimated the state parameters, but also the initial probability vector $\\pi$ and transition matrix $T$ vector. Note that estimating these also get better as more lineages are added (for the $\\pi$ vector in particular) and in general as more cells and more lineages are added."
