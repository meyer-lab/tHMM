It is beneficial to understand how the `CellVar` class is designed to create objects that store a `state`, its relationships (`left`, `right`, `parent`) to other cells, and its multivariate observations (`obs`). When cells are created via the `member` function, their familiar relationships are automatically assigned. The two daughters are assigned to `left` and `right` and for the daughters, the parent is assigned to `parent`. Other familiar relationships can be accessed through other member variables and functions. Note that the first generation is empty (we can see this because the `parent_cell` is instantiated with `parent=None` and with `gen=1` which means that `gen=0` of the lineage contains nothing except `None`). As such, indexing for generations of lineages starts at `1`. We will discuss more about the multivariate observations that cells store later; for now, the following exercises will focus on the transition matrix and the familiar relationships of cells."

The daughter cells of any cell can also ALWAYS be accessed using \"dot\" notation, using the member variables, `left` and `right`. Note that the division process utilizes the transition matrix.

For example, if one is observing kinematics or physics, they might want to use the Gaussian distribution parameterized by a mean and covariance to model their observations (velocity, acceleration, etc.). If one wanted to model lifetimes of cell, one could utilize one of many of the exponential distributions with a nonnegative support to define time.\n",

The second emission is continuous and are gamma distributed. Though these can be thought of cell lifetimes or periods in a certain cell phase, we want the user to know that these values can really mean anything and they are completely free in choosing what the emissions and their values mean. We provide, as mentioned above, a probability distribution function that takes in as input multivariate samples, a Bernoulli rate parameter, and three parameters that define the gamma distribution, and returns a likelihood.

    "We can estimate the parameters of the state distributions that make up our cells by running the estimator built into our state distribution objects. Recall that these are stored in the Emissions list of state distribution objects `E`. Calling the estimator member function (using dot notation again) on a set of tuples that represent the observations held in each cell can give us the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (the best frequentist estimate) of the parameters that describe the distributions that the cells were originally sampled from. This is a good way of pre-checking if our model can analyze your data using synthetic lineages, before you begin running wet lab experiments to collect actual observations. This is also a good way to check that everything is working internally, apart from running tests."

This model primarily has to segment or partition the tree and its cells into the number of states we think is present in our data, and then identify the parameters that describe each state's distributions. We can not only check how well it estimated the state parameters, but also the initial probability vector $\\pi$ and transition matrix $T$ vector.
