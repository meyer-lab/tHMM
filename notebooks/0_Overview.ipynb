It is beneficial to understand how the `CellVar` class is designed to create objects that store a `state`, its relationships (`left`, `right`, `parent`) to other cells, and its multivariate observations (`obs`). When cells are created via the `member` function, their familiar relationships are automatically assigned. The two daughters are assigned to `left` and `right` and for the daughters, the parent is assigned to `parent`. Other familiar relationships can be accessed through other member variables and functions. Note that the first generation is empty (we can see this because the `parent_cell` is instantiated with `parent=None` and with `gen=1` which means that `gen=0` of the lineage contains nothing except `None`). As such, indexing for generations of lineages starts at `1`.
