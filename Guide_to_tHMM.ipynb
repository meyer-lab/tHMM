For example, we've written a `StateDistribution` class that provides a Bernoulli and gamma multivariate random variable, parameterized by the Bernoulli rate parameter (`p`), and the three gamma parameters (`a`, `loc`, `scale`). We also provide a probability density function and estimators. We use this to describe the physical observations of fate and lifetime, respectively. Write your answer below."
