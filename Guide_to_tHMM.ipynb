    "The required probabilities are those that define the tree and act of state switching. This process works by first creating a hidden tree of empty cells. Empty cells are those that have their states set but do not have any observations attached to them. We then draw as many observations from each state distribution and assign those observations to those cells. The $\\pi$ and $T$ parameters are easy to define. The number of states is $k$. We require for $\\pi$ a $k\\times 1$ list of probabilities. These probabilities must add up to $1$ and they should be either in a $1$-dimensional list or a $1$-dimensional numpy array. The $T$ parameter should be a square numpy matrix of size $k\\times k$. The rows are the states in which we are transitioning from and the columns are the states in which we are transitioning to. Each row of $T$ should sum to $1$. The columns need not sum to $1$."

    "The emission matrix $E$ is a little more complicated to define because this is where the user has complete freedom in defining what type of observation they care about. In particular, the user has to first begin with defining what observation he or she will want in their cells in their synthetic images. For example, if one is observing kinematics or physics, they might want to use Gaaussian distribution observations. In defining the random variables, the user will pull from a Gaussian distribution based on the mean and standard deviation of the different states he or she picks. They can also utilize the Gaussian probability distribution to define the likelihood as well. Furthermore, they can build an analytical estimator for their state distributions that yield the parameter estimates when given a list of observations. Finally, the user can also define a prune rule, which is essentially a boolean function that inspects a cell's observations and returns True if the cell's subtree (all the cells that are related to the cell in question and are of older generation) is to be pruned or False if the cell is safe from pruning. In the Gaussian example, a user can remove a cell's subtree if its observation is higher or lower than some fixed value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already built, as an example, and as bioengineers, a model that resembles lineage trees. In our synthetic model, our emissions are multivariate. This first emission is a Bernoulli observation, $0$ implying death and $1$ implying division. The second and third emissions are continuous and are from exponential and gamma distributions respectively. Though these can be thought of cell lifetime's or periods in a certain cell phase, we want the user to know that these values can really mean anything and they are completely free in choosing what the emissions and their values mean. We define ways to calculate random variables for these multivariate observations and likelihoods of an observations. We also provide as a prune rule, keeping with the cell analogy, that if a cell has a $0$ in its Bernoulli observation, then its subtree is pruned from the full lineage tree. Though this will obviously introduce bias into estimation, we keep both the full tree and the pruned tree in the lineage objects, in the case a user would like to see the effects of analyzing on one versus the other.\n",

    "Ultimately, $E$ is defined as a $k\\times 1$ size list of state distribution objects. These distribution objects are rich in what they can already do, and a user can easily add more to their functionality. They only need to be instantiated by what parameters define that state's distribution."
