We then draw as many observations from each state distribution and assign those observations to those cells. The $\\pi$ and $T$ parameters are easy to define. The number of states is $k$. We require for $\\pi$ a $k\\times 1$ list of probabilities. These probabilities must add up to $1$ and they should be either in a $1$-dimensional list or a $1$-dimensional numpy array. The $T$ parameter should be a square numpy matrix of size $k\\times k$. The rows are the states in which we are transitioning from and the columns are the states in which we are transitioning to. Each row of $T$ should sum to $1$. The columns need not sum to $1$."

In particular, the user has to first begin with defining what physical observation she will want extract from images of their cells, or test on synthetically created lineages. For example, if one is observing kinematics or physics, they might want to use the Gaussian distribution parameterized by a mean and covaraince to model their observations (velocity, acceleration, etc.). \n",

This first emission is a Bernoulli observation, $0$ implying death and $1$ implying division. The second emission is continuous and are gamma distributed. Though these can be thought of cell lifetime's or periods in a certain cell phase, we want the user to know that these values can really mean anything and they are completely free in choosing what the emissions and their values mean. We provide, as mentioned above, a probability distribution function that takes in as input multivariate samples, a Bernoulli rate parameter, and three parameters that define the gamma distribution, and returns a likelihood. We also define a random variable that takes in a Bernoulli parameter and three gamma parameters and returns multivariate samples. We also define estimators for these observations as well. Finally, we also define a prune rule, as explained previously.\n",
