def get_stationary_distribution(transition_matrix):
    """
    Obtain the stationary distribution given a transition matrix.
    The transition matrix should be in the format preferred by Wikipedia.
    That is, the transition matrix should be square, contain real numbers,
    and be right stochastic.
    This implies that the rows of the transition matrix sum to one (not the columns).
    This also means that the row index (i) represents the state of the previous step,
    and the column index (j) represents the state of the next step.
    If the transition matrix is defined as A, then

    A[i,j] = P(child = j | parent = i).

    Our goal is to find the stationary distribution vector, p, such that

    pA = p.

    This is equivalent to finding the distribution of states that is invariant
    to the Markov transition operation.
    Remark. Due to our transition matrix being right stochastic, the stationary vector
    is a row-vector which is left-multiplying the transition matrix. Using the transpose
    can help with the notation.

    Notation:
    .T is the transpose
    * is the matrix multiplication operation
    I is the identity matrix of size K
    K() is a vector with K number of (), for example,
    K0 is a vector with K number of 0s
    K represents the number of states

    p*A             = p       1
    (p*A).T         = p.T     2
    A.T*p.T         = p.T     3
    A.T*p.T - I*p.T = K0      4
    (A.T - I)*p.T   = K0      5

    Our goal is to solve this equation. To obtain non-trivial solutions for p
    and to constrain the problem, we can add the constraint that the elements of
    p must sum to 1.

    [(A.T - I), K1]*p.T = [K0, 1]      6
    [(A.T - I), K1]     = B            7
    B*p.T               = [K0, 1]      8
    [K0, 1]             = c            9
    B*p.T               = c           10

    However, this is now an over-determined system of linear equations
    (B now has more rows than the number of elements (K) in p).
    Linear equation solvers will be unable to proceed.
    To ameliorate this, we can use the normal equations.

    B.T*B*p.T = B.T*c     11

    Solving this yields the stationary distribution vector.
    We can then check that the stationary distribution vector
    remains unchanged by applying the transition matrix to it
    and obtain the stationary distribution vector again.

    A.T*p.T=p.T  12

    We return this solution as a row vector.
