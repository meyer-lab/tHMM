    generates a list of objects (cells) in a lineage.

    Given an experimental end time, a Bernoulli distribution for
    dividing/dying and a Gompertz/exponential parameter for cell lifetime,
    it creates objects as cells and puts them in a list.
    If the switchT is not None, then after a while it will switch
    to the new bernoulli, Gompertz/Exponential parameters and creates lineages
    based on the new distribution.


    Bernoulli distribution:
        It has one parameter (locBern)
        If locBern = 0.80 then 80% of the times the cells will divide and 20%
        of the times they die; meaning, for every cell that is generated,
        a random number (either 1:divide, or 0:die) is picked from the
        distribution with this parameter and the fate of the cell is assigned.

    Gompertz distribution:
        It has two parameters (cGom, scaleGom)
        Given these two parameters, for every cell, it randomly picks a number
        from the distribution and assigns it to the cell as its lifetime. The unit
        of the lifetime would be in [hours].

    Exponential distribution:
        It has one parameter (betaExp)
        It is a replacement for Gompertz to produce cell's lifetime, given the
        beta parameter, every time we pick a random number from an exponential
        distributions with parameter betaExp, and assign it to be the lifetime
        of the cell.

    Gamma distribution:
        It has two parameters(shape_gamma, scale_gamma)
        Used as alifetime generator for cells. In the range of parameter we work, 
        its pdf looks like a slightly skewed bell-shaped distribution. This happens
        when the shape parameter is >= scale parameter. Here to generate the cells we
        specify the two parameters and it will return a number that we assign to cell's 
        lifetime.

        initCells (int): the number of initial cells to initiate the tree with

        the normal range: [0.5, 5] outside this boundary simulation

        switchT (int): the time (assuming the beginning of experiment is 0) that
