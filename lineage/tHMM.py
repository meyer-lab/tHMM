        In this function, the dictionary is initialized.

        There are three matrices in this function:
            1. "pi" (The initial probability matrix): The matrix holding the probability of
            being in each state at time = 0. This matrix is a [K x 1] matrix assuming
            we have K hidden states. The matrix is initialized uniformly.

            2. "T" (Transition probability matrix): The matrix holding the probability of
            transitioning between different states. This is a [K x K] matrix assuming
            we have K hidden states. The matrix in initialized uniformly.

            3. "E" (Emission probability matrix): The matrix holding the probability of
            emissions (observations) corresponding to each state. In this case, emissions are
            1. whether a cell dies or divides (Bernoulli distribution with 1 parameter)
            2. how long a cell lives:
                2.1. Gompertz distribution with 2 parameters (loc and scale)
                    loc initialized to 2
                    scale initialized to 62.5
                2.2. Exponential distribution with 1 parameter (beta)
                    beta intialized to 62.5

            If the Gompertz is used, on the whole we will have 3 parameters for emissions, so
            the emission matrix will be [K x 3].
            if the Exponential is used, on the whole we will have 2 parameters for emissions, so
