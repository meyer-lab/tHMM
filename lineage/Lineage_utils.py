    Generates a population of lineages that abide by distinct parameters.

    This function uses the same parameters as "GenerateLineageWithTime", along with
    experimentTime to create a population of cells including different lineages.
    The number of lineages would be the same as the number of initial cells we start with,
    Every initial cell and its descendants have the same linID.

        continue growing.

        experimentTime (int) [hours]: the time that the experiment will be running
        to allow for the cells to grow.

        locBern (float): the Bernoulli distribution parameter
        (p = success) for fate assignment (either the cell dies or divides)
        range = [0, 1]

        betaExp (float): the parameter of Exponential distribution.

        switchT (int): the time (assuming the beginning of experiment is 0) that
        we want to switch to the new set of parameters of distributions.

        bern2 (float): second Bernoulli distribution parameter.

        FOM (str): this determines the type of distribution we want to use for
        lifetime here it is either "G": Gompertz, or "E": Exponential.

        population's distribution.
