def get_leaf_Normalizing_Factors(tHMMobj):
    '''
    Normalizing factor (NF) matrix and base case at the leaves.

    Each element in this N by 1 matrix is the normalizing
    factor for each beta value calculation for each node.
    This normalizing factor is essentially the marginal
    observation distribution for a node.

    This function gets the normalizing factor for
    the upward recursion only for the leaves.
    We first calculate the joint probability
    using the definition of conditional probability:

    P(x_n = x | z_n = k) * P(z_n = k) = P(x_n = x , z_n = k),
    where n are the leaf nodes.

    We can then sum this joint probability over k,
    which are the possible states z_n can be,
    and through the law of total probability,
    obtain the marginal observation distribution
    P(x_n = x):

    sum_k ( P(x_n = x , z_n = k) ) = P(x_n = x).

def get_leaf_betas(tHMMobj, NF):
    '''
    beta matrix and base case at the leaves.

    Each element in this N by K matrix is the beta value
    for each cell and at each state. In particular, this
    value is derived from the Marginal State Distributions
    (MSD), the Emission Likelihoods (EL), and the
    Normalizing Factors (NF). Each beta value
    for the leaves is exactly the probability

    beta[n,k] = P(z_n = k | x_n = x).

    Using Bayes Theorem, we see that the above equals

    numerator = P(x_n = x | z_n = k) * P(z_n = k)
    denominator = P(x_n = x)
    beta[n,k] = numerator / denominator

    The first value in the numerator is the Emission
    Likelihoods. The second value in the numerator is
    the Marginal State Distributions. The value in the
    denominator is the Normalizing Factor.
