![** Model prediction accuracy a simulated heterogeneous lineage. Nodes in blue represent therapy-susceptible cells with parameters of ${\theta<sub>B</sub>}^{(1)}=0.8$, ${\lambda<sub>E</sub>}^{(1)}=80$. Nodes in orange are therapy-resistant cancerous cells with parameters of ${\theta<sub>B</sub>}^{(1)}=0.99$, ${\lambda<sub>E</sub>}^{(1)}=20$. The edge color represents the lifetime of the cell it is connected to. Some cells only have one daughter because daughter cells that lived past an experimental end time were excised from the analysis. The true lineage (left) consists of an initially susceptible daughter cell which undergoes a mutation downstream that gives rise to a resistant subpopulation. The tHMM uses the end-of-life fate and lifetime of each of these cells to predict their state classification. The modelâ€™s perfomance (99.19% accurate) is shown on the right.. ...(./Figures/figure3.svg){#fig:tfac}
