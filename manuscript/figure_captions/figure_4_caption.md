![** Model prediction accuracy on a simulated heterogeneous lineage (N=200).] Accuracy of tHMM state assignment (left), Bernoulli parameter estimation (middle), and exponential parameter estimation (right) for lineages composed of initially therapy-sensitive (blue) that then later transitioned to therapy-resistant (orange) subpopulations. Dotted horizontal lines at target accuracy and true population values are depicted. Solid line represents a 10-point moving average. ...(./Figures/figure4.svg){#fig:tfac}
