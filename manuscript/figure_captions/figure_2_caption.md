![** Workflow to obtain phenotypic measurements of cell fitness for use in the tHMM. This procedure begins using time-lapse images to trace parent-daughter linkages over an entire lineage. The lineage, possessing each cell-specific measure of lifetime and fate, is then used to model all latent states (i.e. cell subpopulations) in the sample using Bernoulli and exponential distributions that are fitted with Baum-Welch maximum likelihood estimation. After classifying each subpopulation, the pipeline assigns each cell from the lineage to its respective subpopulation (i.e. hidden state) which provides the quantitative measure for cell-specific resistance to cancer therapy.
