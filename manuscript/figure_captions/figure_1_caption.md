![** tHMM influence diagram for 𝑵 cells with 𝑲 states. The latent states (𝒛) represent subpopulation classification of each cell. The observed states (𝒙) in blue/orange denote measured phenotypes, particularly fitness (i.e. end-of-life fate by binary outcome variable 𝜙, and lifetime by variable 𝜏 in hours). The tHMM is robust to cells that die, such as cell 6.. ...(./Figures/figure2.svg){#fig:tfac}
