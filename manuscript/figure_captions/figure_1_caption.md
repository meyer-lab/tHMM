![** tHMM influence diagram for $𝑵$ cells with $𝑲$ states.] The latent states ($\bm{z}$) represent subpopulation classification of each cell. The observed states ($\bm{x}$) in blue/orange denote measured phenotypes, particularly fitness (i.e. end-of-life fate by binary outcome variable $\phi$, and lifetime by variable $\tau$ in hours). The tHMM is robust to cells that die, such as cell $6$.. ...(./Figures/figure2.svg){#fig:tfac}
