## Discussion

Big picture: Importance of this study:

1. Phenotypic intratumoral heterogeneity induces resistance to drug exposure, so we need to account for them in designing anticancer therapy.

2. It is important to take heritability and cell-cell relations into account while studying the evolution and state transitions.

3. Previous studies have investigated identifying phenotypic heterogeneity using models.

4. The tHMM can help with uncovering the underlying heterogeneity using single-cell lineage data using only experimental obervations.

Additional findings and how this fits to existing literature:

1. tHMM shows high sensitivity for under-represented sub-populations.

2. tHMM has proved to be more accurate than K-means clustering which shows the importance of accounting for history of cells and their relations.

3. tHMM properly handles time-censorship using survivoral function of distributions, which is barely the case in the literature.

4. Insightful findings from lapatinib treatment fitting, and comparing to some literature about effects of lapatinib on breast cancer cells:
- State with higher possibility of cell death, have less cell cycle phase extension (state 3)
- All states have G1 extension, some more and some less.
- Comparison...

5. Insightful findings from gemcitabine treatment fitting and comparing to some literature about effects of gemcitabine on breast cancer cells:
- The effects appear only when the concentration of gemcitabine reaches 10 nM or higher. The drug effects are drastic across concentrations and less smooth compared to lapatinib.
- State 5 with high inward probability, has a very high chance of cell death.
- Comparison...

Critical analysis of our findings and limitations of the study:

1. Discritizing the state, while in reality they are coninuous variables, is a challenging assumption which may cause inaccuracy to some extent.

2. tHMM cannot perform with high accuracy when the states are too close.

3. In the current setting, the measurements are assumed to be independent. If observations are not independent variables, we should account for that in the likelihood function.

4. The experiment time is limited, and we may not have captured slow-fluctuations. Also, it is hard to collect this type of data for longer times due to experimental limitations.

5. Without further experiments, the biological interpretations of each state is not clear. 

future directions:

1. Sequencing cells that have been assigned states after fitting and revealing what could be the distinguishing factor for separating those cells assigned to different states.

2. Integerating information about heterogeneity due to mutations to have a comprehensive insight.

3. Based on the findings from sequencing cells, design combination experiments and assess the efficacy.

4. The model is applicable to a wide range of lineage-tree data to unravel the underlying heterogeneity.
