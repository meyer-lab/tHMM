## Discussion

The model classified all types of synthetic populations of 2 true states with the accuracy higher than 90% for a minimum of ~50 cells in the population. In the cases with fewer number of observation types the accuracy reached almost 100%, however, slightly less accurate with phase-specific observations. The model showed relatively high sensitivity to the populations with under-represented sub-populations and proved efficacious with more distinct state features. Particularly in comparison to K-means clustering algorithm, the average accuracy of state assignment was higher by $15%$. Missing information in the form of time censorship did adversely affect the performance, however, we were able to handle the influence to be minimum. The model selection validated by AIC metric asserted the reliability of tHMM in predicting the most likely number of states within a population.

There are some lineages, however, on which the tHMM performed poorly, in particular lineages with less than 5 cells when they are evaluated for more than 3 states. Also, the model is dependent on the distance between the existing states and may perform poorly when the states are close or when the susceptible cells possessed high variance in parameter estimation. The deviations are also seen in the resistant cells, as some of the exponential estimates were orders of magnitude higher than the true value. The Gamma estimator, similar to any other lifetime distribution, suffered from survivorship bias due to removal of unfinished cells that were still alive at the end of the tracking period. Specifically, cells with longer lifetimes (i.e. higher growth rate) are more likely to live beyond the tracking period. We separated the censored and fully observed values and handled the censored values using a survival function. This unavoidable phenomenon, if not properly handled, could lead to the growth rate parameter approaching a value less than the true value and biased estimation. Although Bernoulli estimations are centered around their respective true values, they suffer from survivorship bias as well because cells with higher Bernoulli parameter divide more often and thus have a higher sample size for prediction. This leads to the resistant cell line possessing more accurate Bernoulli estimations relative to the susceptible subpopulation.

The tHMM accuracy performs maximum likelihood estimation using cell observations from each lineage in the population. Thus, the improved performance accuracy and decrease in its variance as lineage number increases validates the model architecture. Parameter estimation and initial and transition probability matrix estimations were accurate in most cases of synthetic data and the tHMM was able to better distinguish the separate subpopulations as more lineages were added.

In this work, we present a machine learning pipeline, the tHMM, that can analyze tree-structured data using any measurements from the parent and daughter nodes. In particular, we apply our algorithm to a cell imaging protocol that inputs cell fate and G1 and S/G2 phase lengths into the tHMM pipeline and can be used with time-lapsed images for real-time classification. The tHMM is able to construct and analyze cell lineage trees to properly assign cells to different states based on virtually any number of phenotypic properties of cell fitness (in the case of our data, three), and also quantify the likelihood of transitioning to a different state using emissions and the transition rate matrix. Utilizing the AIC metric, the model predicted 3 and 4 distinct subpopulations for lapatinib and gemcitabine-treated data, respectively. We are designing assays to experimentally validate the number of states predicted by tHMM. The current version of this pipeline is most accurate when populations consist of at least 50 cells per lineage. Cell transitions from therapy-susceptible to therapy-resistant states are well detected by the model, which will prove useful for identifying mutant subtypes in tumors and leading to more optimal therapies for cancer treatment. The tHMM may further be used for drug screening as a single-cell, rather than population-based, means of quantifying the potency of novel therapies in eliminating all subpopulations within a tumor. The pipeline will provide researchers and clinicians with an improved classification of heterogeneity among cells, or any other tree-structured data, and provide information about latent changes in cellular identity.
