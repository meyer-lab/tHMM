## Discussion

Intratumoral heterogeneity in cancer cells enables them to adapt in response to therapy. Even in the absence of genetic mutations, other heritable variation serves as a substrate for natural selection [@doi:10.1038/nrg2556]. In this paper, we introduced a tree-based hidden Markov model that classifies single cells from a heterogeneous population based solely on their phenotypic traits and relationships. Benchmarking the model showed that it can provide accurate results using feasible experimental designs. The tHMM showed relatively high sensitivity to subpopulations at lower frequencies (Figs. @fig:wass1, @fig:wass2). Comparing the model to clustering without the lineage relationships showed that relationship information helps to more accurately identify cell states (Fig. @fig:wass). Another critical advancement in the current work is properly handle the missing information in the form of time censorship both at the beginning (left-truncated) and the end of the experiment (right-censored) (Fig. @fig:censor).

We used single cell lineage tracking data of AU565 cancer cells treated with a range of lapatinib and gemcitabine concentrations as a demonstration of the model. G1 and S/G2 cell cycle phase durations and cell fate measurements were used as relevant cell phenotypes to quantify the anti-cancer effects of these drugs. 6 and 5 distinct subpopulations were identified for lapatinib and gemcitabine-treated data, respectively (Fig. @fig:expBIC). The phenotypic features of each state were quantified (Figs. @fig:emissionsLPT,  @fig:emissionsGMC). Lapatinib is known to inhibit cell proliferation by inhibiting Akt/mTOR pathway activity, which is a key regulator of G1 phase progression, and decreases the rate of DNA synthesis in AU565 cells [@doi:10.1002/jcb.24611]. Similarly, our analysis in the lapatinib-treated population indicated that cells regardless of their states experience prolonged G1 phase, where some states show more susceptibility. Finally, we observed that those states with a higher possibility of cell death had lesser effects on the duration of each cell cycle phase (e.g., state 3).

In our analysis, we observed that the majority of the predicted states in gemcitabine-treated cells are stable, but also found more disperse effects over the predicted states. Phase arrest or cell death effects in cells treated with gemcitabine appear only when the concentration of gemcitabine reaches 10 nM or higher. Cells in state 5 with a high inward probability, have only a 20% chance of survival in the S/G2 phase, and most G1 cell deaths happen in two stable states (state 1 and 3). Gemcitabine induces prolonged DNA damage and is an excellent candidate for combination therapy [@doi:10.1586/14737140.5.3.429], however, there is limited literature about the effects of gemcitabine specifically on AU565 cells or in general, HER2-overexpressing cells.

Modeling and experimental advancements will work to further improve our approach for quantifying tumor cell heterogeneity phenotypically. With the model, cells may express a continuum, rather than discrete, phenotypic states [@doi:10.1182/blood2018-03-791517]. If this is the case, a continuous latent variable model would lead to a refined view of the population-level heterogeneity. However, a discrete model like the one used here should still provide an accurate estimate by breaking up the continuous state-space. Continuous latent variable models also have additional challenges in implementation and interpretation [CITE]. Careful handling of each states’ phenotypic distributions might also improve the model’s accuracy and power to identify distinct states. For example, the eventual fate of cells and their cell cycle durations are likely correlated, necessitating a multivariate distribution accounting for this covariance [@doi:doi.org/10.1038/msb.2012.1]. This becomes even more important with incorporation of other phenotypic information such as migration, cell shape, or other features, all of which will be correlated to some extent.

Experimental advancements will also improve the utility and accuracy of this approach. Currently our experimental data is limited to 96 hours, covering up to 5 or 6 generations of cells. Traits such as resistance may develop over more generations and longer timescales [CITE]. Longer data collection becomes challenging due to factors such as phototoxicity and cell stress [@doi:10.3791/53994]. Improved imaging modalities and experimental platforms might allow longer tracking experiments, with reduced phototoxicity, in more physiologically representative environments such as engineering 3D extracellular matrix [CITE]. Currently, the model is agnostic as to whether the heterogeneity it identifies is pre-existing or drug-induced. Collecting data in which cells are tracked before and after drug treatment would enable some linkage between the pre- and post-exposure phenotypes of cells [@doi:10.1038/s41587-021-00837-3]. Finally, while we identify these states as subpopulations of cells that are phenotypically distinct, we currently cannot comment on the molecular factors leading to these phenotypes. However, we expect that single cell molecular analyses such as transcriptional profiling, tied with molecular barcodes, should allow us to align molecular and phenotypic states in the same populations of cells [@doi:10.1038/nri.2017.76].

As a follow-up study, we intend to design assays to experimentally validate the number of states predicted by tHMM, and study the extent and sources of differences between the identified states. The tHMM may further be used for drug screening as a single cell, rather than population-based, means of quantifying the potency of novel therapies in eliminating all subpopulations within a tumor. The pipeline will provide researchers and clinicians with an improved classification of heterogeneity among cells, or any other tree-structured data, and provide information about latent changes in cellular identity. This model integrated with information about mutational variations that lead to phenotypic heterogeneity would be extremely useful to design comprehensive therapy regimens in the presence of heterogeneity.
