### Performance on uncensored single lineage of increasing size

![**Performance on uncensored single lineages of increasing size.** Single uncensored lineages with fate and time observations are simulated with two states. The time observations are gamma distributed with shape and scale parameters. Lineages are created synthetically and the model's performance in estimation and state assignment accuracy are plotted against the total number of cells in each lineage. These lineages cannot represent real cells because cells that are daughters of cells that have died are observed in these plots. Horizontal markers of a lighter color (either light orange or light blue) represent the true value for that parameter. Because it is difficult to estimate the mixing ratio (the probability of the initial cell belonging to a certain state) when working with only a single lineage, the model is given a fixed mixing ratio, such that it does not have to estimate it. As such, the error in estimating the initial probability vector, or the mixing ratio, is not presented. Accuracies should approach 100% and errors should approach 0.](./output/figureS01.svg){#fig:ideal_1}

### Performance on uncensored multiple lineages of increasing size

![**Performance on uncensored populations of lineages of increasing number.** Populations of uncensored lineages with fate and time observations are simulated with two states. The time observations are gamma distributed with shape and scale parameters. The number of included lineages in the populations is increased and the total cell count is recorded. Populations (groups of lineages with fixed sized) are created and the model's performance in estimation and state assignment accuracy are plotted against the total cell count. These lineages cannot represent real cells because cells that are daughters of cells that have died are observed. Horizontal markers of a lighter color (either light orange or light blue) represent the true value of that parameter. Accuracies should approach 100% and errors should approach 0.](./output/figureS02.svg){#fig:ideal_2}

### Performance on censored multiple lineages of increasing size

![**Performance on censored multiple lineages of increasing size.** Multiple uncensored lineages with fate and time observations are simulated with two states. Lineages are created and the model's performance in estimation and state assignment accuracy are plotted against the total number of cells in each lineage. Each cell contains four observations: the fate at the end of G1, the fate at the end of G2, and the times spent in G1 and G2. The times are each gamma distributed with shape and scale parameters. These lineages can represent real cells because these populations have been properly and randomly censored. Because it is difficult to estimate the mixing ratio (the probability of the initial cell belonging to a certain state) when working with only a single lineage, the model is given a fixed mixing ratio, such that it does not have to estimate it. As such, the error in estimating the initial probability vector, or the mixing ratio, is not presented. Horizontal markers of a lighter color (either light orange or light blue) represent the true value of that parameter. Accuracies should approach 100% and errors should approach 0.](./output/figureS03.svg){#fig:ideal_3}

### Change in model performance when varying presence of a state for uncensored population

![**Change in model performance when varying presence of state in uncensored lineages.** Single uncensored lineages with fate and time observations are simulated with two states. The transition matrices that generate these lineages are varied such that the relative proportion of cells in each state vary. In particular, transition matrices initially bias cells to divide into only cells in the second state and force lineage trees to be entirely made of cells in the second state. A range of transition matrices are made that create lineages which bias the number of cells to be in one state or another. The proportion of cells in the first state in the lineage is recorded.](./output/figureS04.svg){#fig:prop4}

### Change in model performance when varying presence of a state for censored population

![**Performance on populations of censored lineages of increasing number.** Populations of censored lineages with fate and time observations are simulated with two states. The number of included lineages in the populations is increased and the total cell count is recorded. The time observations are gamma distributed with shape and scale parameters. Cells that die or live past the desired experiment time have their subtrees (the lineages created by their possible daughters) removed. Populations are created and the model's performance in estimation and state assignment accuracy are plotted against the total cell count. Horizontal markers of a lighter color (either light orange or light blue) represent the true value for that parameter. Accuracies should approach 100% and errors should approach 0.](./output/figureS05.svg){#fig:real_5}

### Change in model performance when varying state distribution similarity for uncensored populations

![**Change in model performance when varying state distribution similarity with uncensored population of lineages.** Uncensored lineages in a population with fate and time observations are simulated with two states. These lineages are created in such a way that cells from each state are well represented in the lineage (the states are evenly distributed). One state is fixed and the other is allowed to vary in terms of its distribution. Initially, the two states are the same, i.e., they generate exactly the same distribution of cells. One of the states is then allowed to vary by increasing the gamma shape parameter. Doing so increases the Wassertein distance between the two states. Cells of each state from each lineage are sampled as distributions and are used to calculate the Wasserstein distance between the states. The Bernoulli parameter (a) and the gamma scale parameter (c) are the same for both of the states, but the gamma shape (b) parameter varies for the second state. The model is able to estimate the parameters of the states across all Wasserstein distances but has difficulty when the two states are nearly identical, when the Wasserstein distance between the states is low.](./output/figureS06.svg){#fig:wass1}

### Performance on uncensored single lineage of increasing size given phase specific observations

![**Performance on uncensored single lineages of increasing size.** Single uncensored lineages with G1 and S/G2 phase specific fate and time observations are simulated with two states. The G1 and S/G2 time observations are gamma distributed with shape and scale parameters, and each phase has its own fate parameter. Lineages are created synthetically and the model's performance in estimation and state assignment accuracy are plotted against the total number of cells in each lineage. These lineages cannot represent real cells because cells that are daughters of cells that have died are observed in these plots. Horizontal markers of a lighter color represent the true value for that parameter. Because it is difficult to estimate the mixing ratio (the probability of the initial cell belonging to a certain state) when working with only a single lineage, the model is given a fixed mixing ratio, such that it does not have to estimate it. As such, the error in estimating the initial probability vector, or the mixing ratio, is not presented. Accuracies should approach 100% and errors should approach 0.](./output/figureS08.svg){#fig:prop8}
