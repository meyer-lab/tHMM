### Performance on uncensored lineages of increasing size

<!-- (Supp. Figure 1) -->

![**Performance on uncensored single lineages of increasing size.** Single uncensored lineages with fate and time observations are simulated with two states. The time observations are gamma distributed with shape and scale parameters. Lineages are created synthetically and the model's performance in estimation and state assignment accuracy are plotted against the total number of cells in each lineage. These lineages cannot represent real cells because cells that are daughters of cells that have died are observed in these plots. Horizontal markers of a lighter color (either light orange or light blue) represent the true value for that parameter. Because it is difficult to estimate the mixing ratio (the probability of the initial cell belonging to a certain state) when working with only a single lineage, the model is given a fixed mixing ratio, such that it does not have to estimate it. As such, the error in estimating the initial probability vector, or the mixing ratio, is not presented. Accuracies should approach 100% and errors should approach 0.](./output/figureS01.svg){#fig:ideal_1}

The time observations are gamma distributed with shape and scale parameters. The number of included lineages in the populations is increased and the total cell count is recorded. Populations (groups of lineages with fixed sized) are created and the model's performance in estimation and state assignment accuracy are plotted against the total cell count. These lineages cannot represent real cells because cells that are daughters of cells that have died are observed. Horizontal markers of a lighter color (either light orange or light blue) represent the true value of that parameter.

![**Performance on uncensored single lineages of increasing size.** Single uncensored lineages with fate and time observations are simulated with two states. Lineages are created and the model's performance in estimation and state assignment accuracy are plotted against the total number of cells in each lineage. Each cell contains four observations: the fate at the end of G1, the fate at the end of G2, and the lifetimes spent in G1 and G2. The lifetimes are each gamma distributed with shape and scale parameters. These lineages cannot represent real cells because cells that are daughters of cells that have died are observed in these plots. Furthermore, cells that have died in G1 still have observations about their fate and lifetime in G2. Because it is difficult to estimate the mixing ratio (the probability of the initial cell belonging to a certain state) when working with only a single lineage, the model is given a fixed mixing ratio, such that it does not have to estimate it. As such, the error in estimating the initial probability vector, or the mixing ratio, is not presented.

### Change in model performance when varying presence of state

![**Change in model performance when varying presence of state in uncensored lineages.** Single uncensored lineages with fate and time observations are simulated with two states. The transition matrices that generate these lineages are varied such that the relative proportion of cells in each state vary. In particular, transition matrices initially bias cells to divide into only cells in the second state and force lineage trees to be entirely made of cells in the second state. A range of transition matrices are made that create lineages which bias the number of cells to be in one state or another. The proportion of cells in the first state in the lineage is recorded.](./output/figureS07.svg){#fig:prop7}

### Change in model performance when varying state distribution similarity

![**Change in model performance when varying state distribution similarity with uncensored lineages.** Single uncensored lineages with fate and time observations are simulated with two states. These lineages are created in such a way that cells from each state are well represented in the lineage (the states are evenly distributed). One state is fixed and the other is allowed to vary in terms of its distribution. Initially, the two states are the same, i.e., they generate exactly the same distribution of cells. One of the states is then allowed to vary by increasing the gamma shape parameter. Doing so increases the Wassertein distance between the two states. Cells of each state from each lineage are sampled as distributions and are used to calculate the Wasserstein distance between the states. The Bernoulli parameter (a) and the gamma scale parameter (c) are the same for both of the states, but the gamma shape (b) parameter varies for the second state. The model is able to estimate the parameters of the states across all Wasserstein distances but has difficulty when the two states are nearly identical, when the Wasserstein distance between the states is low.](./output/figureS09.svg){#fig:wass1}

### AIC Figure

some introduction...
![Model prediction accuracy on a simulated cell population with varying numbers of lineages. Accuracy of tHMM state assignment (left), Bernoulli parameter estimation (middle), and exponential parameter estimation (right) for populations of cells with different numbers of lineages. This is analogous to increasing the number of initial seeded cells. Lineages were composed of initially therapy sensitive (blue) that then later transitioned to resistant (orange) subpopulations. Dotted horizontal lines at target accuracy and true population values are depicted. Solid line represents a 10-point moving average. ...](./output/figureS11.svg){#fig:AIC}
