![**Performance on uncensored single lineages of increasing size.** Single uncensored lineages with fate and time observations are simulated with two states. The time observations are gamma distributed with shape and scale parameters. Lineages are created synthetically and the model's performance in estimation and state assignment accuracy are plotted against the total number of cells in each lineage. These lineages cannot represent real cells because cells that are daughters of cells that have died are observed in these plots.

The time observations are gamma distributed with shape and scale parameters. Lineages are created synthetically and the model's performance in estimation and state assignment accuracy are plotted. These lineages can represent real cells and real experimental data because cells that are daughters of cells that have died are not observed. Cells that live past the experiment time are also cut out from the synthetic lineage. In summary, cells that die or live past the desired experiment time have their subtrees (the sub-lineages created by their possible daughters) removed.

### Change in model performance when varying presence of state

![**Change in model performance when varying presence of state in uncensored lineages.** Single uncensored lineages with fate and time observations are simulated with two states. The transition matrices that generate these lineages are varied such that the relative proportion of cells in each state vary. In particular, transition matrices initially bias cells to divide into only cells in the second state and force lineage trees to be entirely made of cells in the second state. A range of transition matrices are made that create lineages which bias the number of cells to be in one state or another. The proportion of cells in the first state in the lineage is recorded.](./output/figureS06.svg){#fig:prop6}

![**Change in model performance when varying presence of state in censored lineages.** Single censored lineages with fate and time observations are simulated with two states.

### Change in model performance when varying state distribution similarity

![**Change in model performance when varying state distribution similarity with uncensored lineages.** Single uncensored lineages with fate and time observations are simulated with two states. These lineages are created in such a way that cells from each state are well represented in the lineage (the states are evenly distributed). One state is fixed and the other is allowed to vary in terms of its distribution. Initially, the two states are the same, i.e., they generate exactly the same distribution of cells. One of the states is then allowed to vary by increasing the gamma shape parameter. Doing so increases the Wassertein distance between the two states. Cells of each state from each lineage are sampled as distributions and are used to calculate the Wasserstein distance between the states. The Bernoulli parameter (a) and the gamma scale parameter (c) are the same for both of the states, but the gamma shape (b) parameter varies for the second state. The model is able to estimate the parameters of the states across all Wasserstein distances but has difficulty when the two states are nearly identical, when the Wasserstein distance between the states is low.](./output/figureS08.svg){#fig:wass1}

### AIC Figure

some introduction...
![Model prediction accuracy on a simulated cell population with varying numbers of lineages. Accuracy of tHMM state assignment (left), Bernoulli parameter estimation (middle), and exponential parameter estimation (right) for populations of cells with different numbers of lineages. This is analogous to increasing the number of initial seeded cells. Lineages were composed of initially therapy sensitive (blue) that then later transitioned to resistant (orange) subpopulations. Dotted horizontal lines at target accuracy and true population values are depicted. Solid line represents a 10-point moving average. ...](./output/figureS10.svg){#fig:AIC}
