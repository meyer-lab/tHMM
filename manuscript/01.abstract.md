## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Cell plasticity, or the ability of cells within a population to reversibly alter epigenetic state, is an important feature of tissue homeostasis during processes such as wound healing and is dysregulated in cancer. Plasticity is further linked to other sources of cell-cell heterogeneity, including genetic mutations and variation in signaling during drug-resistance development. Ultimately these processes prevent most cancer therapies from being curative. The predominant methods of quantifying tumor-drug response operate on population-level measurements and therefore lack evolutionary dynamics, which are particularly critical for highly dynamic processes such as plasticity. Here, we apply a tree-based adaptation of a hidden Markov model (tHMM) that employs single-cell lineages as input, to learn the characteristic patterns of single-cell heterogeneity and state transitions in an unsupervised fashion. This model enables single-cell classification based on the phenotype of individual cells and their relatives for improved specificity when pinpointing the molecular drivers of variability in drug response. Integrating this model with a probabilistic language for defining observed phenotypes allows the model to easily be adapted to any phenotype measured in single cells. We paired cell fate with either cell lifetimes or cell cycle phase lengths (G1 and S/G2) as our observed phenotypes on synthetic data and demonstrated that the model successfully classifies cells within experimentally-tractable dataset sizes. As an application, we analyzed experimental measurements of cell fate and phase duration to determine the number of distinct subpopulations. In total, this tHMM framework allows for the flexible classification of single-cell heterogeneity of heritable traits across lineages.

## Summary points

- A lineage tree-based hidden Markov model (tHMM) quantifies cell-to-cell variability and dynamic population changes.
- Using a modular, probabilistic definition of observed phenotypes allows the model to work with a wide variety of measurements.
- The model accurately classifies cells within experimentally tractable dataset sizes.
- Classifying cells based on their phenotypic heterogeneity can uncover resistance mechanisms hidden at the population level.

## Author Summary

Heterogeneous traits, such as resistance or susceptibility to a drug, can be correlated across related cells because of partially inherited factors. These acquired traits of resistance may be the result of the microenvironment, epigenetics, or mutations. Using cellâ€™s relationships we capture these dynamic transitions between different cell states and arrive at a more accurate quantification of cell heterogeneity within tumor populations. Our computational approach employing a modified hidden Markov model provides greater specificity by identifying intratumor resistance on a single cell level based on lineage histories and can identify dynamic changes in population structure upon treatment.
