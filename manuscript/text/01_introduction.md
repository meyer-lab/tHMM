Cell heterogeneity, such as variability in drug response, arises as cells proliferate. Shared heterogeneous traits, such as a response to drug like resistance or susceptibility within a subpopulation, are correlated across a lineage because resistant subpopulations most likely diverged from a common progenitor or a set of common progenitors that were _also_ resistant or had acquired traits leading to resistance. These acquired traits of resistance may be the result of responses to cellular microenvironments, epigenetics, and/or mutations. Using lineage tree information, we hope to capture these dynamic transitions between heterogeneous latent states of cells and arrive with a more accurate identification of cell heterogeneity in a tumor. Our computational approach employing Markov random field theory provides higher specificity through identifying intratumor resistance on an individual cell level based on lineage histories and enables real-time identification of changes in resistance throughout therapy.
