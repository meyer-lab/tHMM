## Results

### Our model provides more insight than population-level analyses into data with heterogeneous cell-types.

<!-- # "Figure 1" -->

As a motivating trivial scenario, we present two cases of cell population growth over time, one where the population is homogeneous and all cells show consistent behaviour across their observed phenotype and one where the population can be clustered into at least two subpopulations, each with different growth rates (Figure [@fig:lineage]b). To further our motivation, we consider "tumor growth rate" as the phenotype of interest operationalized by a cell's lifetime and its fate in a lineage. Identification of tumor growth rate has a wide range of applications in prognostics and can provide quantified therapeutic effects while different treatment modalities are in use [@doi:10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb02591.x; @doi:10.7326/0003-4819-89-1-107]. Differing tumor growth rates can imply the presence of multiple subpopulations of tumors in a cancer; such subpopulations can show variablility in drug response as well. Figure [@fig:lineage]a shows the usual view of cell lineages, where a homogeneous population contains cells that are each dividing in a similar fashion; Figure [@fig:lineage]b shows a heterogeneous population of cells clustered into two distinct states shown in two different colors. Over time, the two populations look similar with regards to their individual lineages, their seeding density (how they are initialized) and their final cell count at end of the experiment. Assuming that both popluations undergo exponential growth, the doubling rate, and consequently, the estimated collective tumor growth rate, for both cases will inevitably be equal. Via these usual methods of analysis, the heterogeneity of the second population has been masked out and not captured. Ideally, a method used to analyze the growth properties of lineage data should be able to identify the distinct subpopulations within the lineages, and take their presence into account when calculating population-level insights. Utilizing the tHMM model we have built, we are not only able to capture the heterogeneity present in the population shown in Figure [@fig:lineage]b, but also able to quantify the relative presence of these two states, summarizing the characteristics of the observed subpopulations as probabilstic distributions. Although the growth rate (or doubling time) yielded by the usual population-level methods and the tHMM for the homogeneous case are equivalent, without recognizing the heterogeneity in the population, usual methods fail in predicting the long-term growth properties in the second case correctly.

As mentioned before, the capability to identify phenotypic heterogeneity in a population of cancer cells is critical when designing anti-cancer regimens and drug combination protocols. Cell kinetics such as inter-mitotic times, cell cycle phase durations, death and division, and other phenotypic characteristics such as cell morphology, protein and transcription factor levels, etc., are important targets for cancer chemotherapy, hence, important to identify subpopulations with distinct phenotypic responses after drug exposures. Given single-cell data of any heritable phenotype, our proposed model can disentgle subpopulations that respond to the exposure differently from one another.

### Model interface including inputs and outputs  

<!-- # (Figure 2) -->

In this section, the interface of the model and possible input/outputs are explained. The input raw data is assumed to be a quantitative measurements of some phenotype in single-cell level, such as inter-mitotic times, cell cycle phase duration, etc., in which the relationship between the cells is preseved as a binary tree, shown in Figure 2a. The tHMM takes in lineages in the form of an object in Python which consists of a list of cells within that lineage. Each individual cell is an object with its own properties associated with it such as cell's observations, cell's state (which is assigned to it after fitting), its start and end time (relative to the start of the experiment), cell's generation, etc., and accessibility to its ancestors and decendants. The proposed package includes instructions and functions to create objects of cells and lineages from an input data file. After creating the lineage objects, a list of lineages are inputted to the tHMM for fitting where an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm runs until convergence (Figure 2b). The Expectation step takes in an estimation of the model's parameters and the tree of the observations, and outputs the most likely prediction of the tree of states. In the maximization step, a prediction of tree of states and the tree of observations are inputted, and the most likely estimation of model parameters associated with observations are outputted.

The tHMM can provide various statistical outputs as a result of fitting, such as the probability of transition between the states, the most likely state of each individual cell, the most fitted distribution associated with each state, and the most likely number of states in a population (Figure 2c). To address the possibility of incorporating numerous phenotypes that can cause heterogeneity within a population, the model is made flexible in terms of the types of heritable measurements that could be used as clustering features. As shown in figure 2a, any observation can be added into the property list of individual cells. Any new phenotype requires the user to define a possible distribution to which the phenotype belongs.

### States are completely user-defined and virtually any population of cells with hertiable phenotypes can be modeled.

<!-- introduction of phenotype choices, walking through how cell fate can be modeled. -->
Because the goal of our model is to identify states, we have packaged with our model a light-weight framework for developing and using states. Cell states are defined by quantifiable differences in cell phenotype such as gene expression, inter-mitotic times, post-translational modification, morphology, and production of proteins [@pmid:30450444]. Additionally, cell states can be grouped by functional properties such as resistance to drugs and tumor-seeding abilities [@pmid:21854987]. Obtaining quantifiable data of cell state transitions across a lineage has relevant applications in bioengineering and drug development such as understanding and predicting the dynamic nature of cancer cells acquiring drug resistance. In systems biology, populations of cells are grouped by cell state and the data collected can be used to predict an accurate variable response in cell behavior. This cell heterogeneity, which can be caused by genetic variability as well as non-genetic mechanisms, enables cells to adapt to varying environments and is thus relevant for the study of anticancer drug development [@pmid:20371339]. We define states as multivariate probabilistic distributions, which in turn, are defined by the set of parameters that describe those very distributions. The observed phenotypes for cells in a lineage tree can be viewed as realizations of these multivariate probabilistic distributions. As a simple example, we can consider only observing the end fate of a cell. Interpreting this as a random variable, the fate of a cell can be represented as the outcome of a Bernoulli random trial: if a cell lives and divides, then the random variable is 1 and if a cell dies, then the random variable is 0. For each cell, the observed phenotype of its fate, either 1 or 0, can be seen as a sampling of the state it belongs to. The Bernoulli probability distribution is parameterized by a single rate parameter which describes the rate at which 1 is more likely than 0 as the outcome of a random trial. In this simple scenario, each state is another Bernoulli probability distribution, defined by its unique rate parameter. Ultimately, the goal of our model is to identify an optimal number of states, identify which cells belong to which states, and have the states represent the observed phenotypes of the cells in that state. Continuing the same example, if the model were to look for two states in a given cell population, then it might define the cells that divide more often into the first state, and the other set of cells that die more often into a second state. Because each state in this example is a Bernoulli probability distribution that describes the observed phenotypes of the cells that belong to that state, the first state will have a Bernoulli parameter that is larger than that of the second state. 

<!-- Adding the phase lengths to the observations and explain distributions and parameters associated with it. A touch on censorship. -->
In the case that we present, we observe the times that each cell spent in both G1 and S/G2, as well as the fate observed at the end of each of those phases. As before, the fates can be operationalized as Bernoulli random variables, where a random variable of 1 for the end of G1 fate represents a transition into G2, and a 0 would represent death, and likewise, a random variable of 1 for the end of G2 fate represents division, and a 0 would represent death. Furthermore, to represent the time spent in the G1 and G2 phases, we use two gamma random variables, each parameterized by a pair of shape and scale parameters. Note that if a cell were to die in G1, no information about G2 will be known or observed. Additionally, if cell lived past a desired experiment time then, the full observation of its time spent in whatever phase it was in will also be incomplete. These are two of the many cases of censorship that affect data collection as well as how the model analyses the data, and is discussed in greater detail later on. In the previous simple case, states were simply different Bernoulli distributions with unique rate parameters. In our case, states are multivariate and are composed of two Bernoulli distributions and two gamma distributions. These states are described by six parameters in total, two Bernoulli rate parameters and two pairs of gamma shape and scale parameters. In general, any observable heritable phenotype that can be operationalized into a probabilistic distribution can be used to represent a state. Some examples include using a Gaussian distributed random variable to describe average cell motility, parameterized by its mean and variance. One state might describe cells that move faster while other states might describe cells that move slower. This example can be extended to include Gaussian random variables for both cell velocity and acceleration to describe cell kinematics in general.

<!-- some complementray explanation of how to work with new observations. -->
Computationally, these states are user-defined classes instantiated by the parameters that describe them. Fundamentally, if a state is to be used to analyze data collected from single-cell lineage experiments, then a state needs to include a list of parameters, a probability distribution function that takes in a tuple of observations and a list of distribution parameters and returns a likelihood, and an maximum likelihood estimator that can take in tuples of observations and return a list of parameter estimates. If one were to use their definition of a state to create computational synthetic lineages of cells, then the user would also have to provide a random variable function that takes in a list of distribution parameters of inputs, and outputs a tuple of realizations, which would be synthetic observations of cells.

### Experiments of finite time necessitate data censorship corrections

Modeling the duration of each cell’s lifetime is complicated by the influence of experimental factors. Specifically, cells at the beginning or end of the experiment are cutoff and so, while we observe them, we do not know the duration of their cell cycle phases. One cannot simply remove these cells as this will create a systematic bias in the model; for example, this would create an upper bound on the possible lifetime of a cell. To account for this experimental effect, we can instead observe that we do know a cell lived at least as long as the duration we observe.

To incorporate this effect into our model, we marked cells or their specific cell cycle phase that encountered the bounds of the experiment as censored. When estimating the properties of a state’s lifetime or the probability of a cell’s observation these cells instead used a censored estimator or the survival function of the distribution. Using synthetic data, we were able to verify that we could obtain similar accuracies between lineages that had no cells affected by either cell death or experiment duration, and lineages that were affected by these experimental effects (Fig. @fig:censor).

### Performance on synthetic lineages

<!-- ("Figure 5") -->
<!-- explaining synthetic data. reporting some observations from the figures.-->
To indicate our model's performance in terms of state assignment accuracy and distribution parameter estimation, we created a synthetic population of cells, including a number of lineages. The synthetic data is meant to posses the properties of real experimental data where the true states of individual cells is known. To create the synthetic lineages, we assumed to have the following phenotypic  measurements: 1- whether a cell survives G1 phase and transitions to S/G2 phase, 2- whether a cell survives G2 phase and divides, 3- G1 phase duration, and 4- S/G2 phase duration. For a population with 2 known states, we need two sets of different parameters corresponding to the distributions of each phenotypic measurement. After creating a desired number of cells for each state, we randomly generated phenotypic measurements associated with the two sets of distribution parameters for the exact number of cells in each state. The observations corresponding to each state were then assigned to the cells, so that we would have a population of cells in 2 states, each cell with its observation associated with the true state it is in.    
To confirm the minimum number of cells needed in the population of interest that reach $95%$ accuracy, we created lineages with varying lengths, performed the fitting on them, and calculated the accuracy and estimated the distribution parameters. Figure 5a represents the population growth over time in which both the depth and breadth of the population increases. The state assignment accuracy is represented in Figure 5b. With $90%$ being the highest accuracy, we can conclude that $~150$ cells are enough to reach it. Figure 5c shows the difference between the predicted and true transition matrix and initial probability matrix is decreasing as the population grows larger. Figure 5d-i depict the estimated parameters (solid lines) as well as the true parameters corresponding to each phenotype. It is evident that by the time the cell number reaches $~150$, the estimation becomes fairly accurate.

![**Model performance on censored lineages of increasing breadth and depth.** Two state populations of increasing breadth (increasing number of lineages or initial cells) and of increasing depth (increasing experiment time) are analyzed. Their model performance, as based on state assignment accuracy, the error bewteen the estimated and the true transition rate matrix and the initial probability vector, and the accuracy in estimating the parameters underlying the two state distributions are shown.](./output/figure5.svg){#fig:5}


### Identifying states requires partially, but not fully, distinct phenotypes

Cells of even very distinct molecular state can have partly overlapping phenotypes. Therefore, we sought to evaluate how different two states would need to be for us to identify them as distinct (Fig. [@fig:wass]A). We varied the G1 phase duration from identical to very distinct (Fig. [@fig:wass]B) and quantified the accuracy of our model. While the phenotypic observation of a given state had to be different for our model to accurately assign cells, even overlapping phenotypes could be distinguished by using the lineage relationships of cells (Fig. [@fig:wass]C). This shows that the heritability of a cell state can be used to more accurately identify cells with partially overlapping phenotypes.

<!-- ("Figure 7") -->
### The relative presence of states in a population is important because our model depends on non-ancillary sample statistics.

<!-- the importance of recognizing under-represented subpopulations. -->
While the tools we currently have to identify heterogeneity in tumors are limited, this phenomenon indicates that it is necessary to consider underrepresented clusters in solid tumors, such as those that have gained resistance to anticancer drugs through environmental conditions, selective pressure, and cell-state transitions. In order to develop sufficient cancer therapy, it is important to recognize the existence of such tumor cells that gain resistance through non-genetic means and are not typically targeted for anticancer drugs so that we are able to accurately identify and predict the patterns that tumors gain drug resistance [@pmid:31449515].

<!-- Again, the importance of recognizing under-represented subpopulations -->
<!-- In the presence of heterogeneity with a compound that inhibits growth, at least three situations can exist: (1) The compound could have an equal effect across cell subpopulations, (2) the compound could exclusively influence growth within one subpopulation, (3) the compound could shift the relative abundance of subpopulations. Each of these situations has consequences for the potential biological mechanisms of resistance as well as how one might consider drug combinations. For example, in the second situation, one should focus efforts on drugs with the maximal effect in the unaffected subpopulation. Thus, it is crucial to be able to identify those subpopulations that form even a small proportion of the population. -->

<!-- creating the population that includes under-represented cell states, adn explaining the figure. -->
To test our model's capability to identify under-represented populations, we created a synthetic population of 2 states and varied the proportion of cells in these states while keeping the total cell number relatively constant. Fig. @fig:prop a represents the successive state proportion changes from the left to the right, where the proportion of cells in the two states change from 0% to 100%. Fig. @fig:prop b and c depict the accuracy of state assignment while changing the proportion of states in the lineages from 0% in state 1 (equivalent to 100% in state 2) to 100% in state 1 (corresponding to 0% in state 2) for censored and fully observed populations, respectively. The difference between the performance of model in censored and uncensored population is magnified when the population is filled with more than 90% of the dominant state. Intuitively, when the population is in balance and the two state almost have the same proportion of the total cells, the accuracy of state assignment is the highest. It is evident that our model reaches the best performance when the proportion of cells in the two states are almost 80%-20%, implying that the model has the resolution of identifying a subpopulation 1/5 of the total cells with the highest accuracy, and even smaller proportions with approximately 80%. **This should be changed after improving the accuracy**.

![**Model performance relative to the presence of each state.** (a) A visual representation of how lineages and populations can have different proportions of their total cell population be represented by different states. (b) Populations with different ratios of cells belonging to one state over the other are made. The ratio of the number of cells in state 1 to the number of cells in state 2 increases from 1:10 to 9:10. This is achieved by synthetically creating lineages with transition rates that bias towards making one state over the other. Model performance relative to the presence of that state is shown.](./output/figure7.svg){#fig:prop}

### Model selection effectively identifies the number of distinct states

Usually it is unclear how many distinct cell states may exist within a population. Further, the number of states identified may depend on the environmental context of the cells, particularly because we use phenotypic measurements. To test whether we could determine the number of distinct states, we performed model selection using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and models with varying numbers of states (Fig. @fig:sAIC). The predicted number of cell states was predominantly correct, and incorrect predictions still centered around the true answer, for both uncensored and censored lineages (Fig. @fig:sAIC). This indicates that model selection can help to identify the appropriate number of cell states given a set of measurements.

<!-- figure 9 -->
### The model applied on experimental data of phase-specific observations

To show the performance of the model on single-cell experimental data we employed phenotypic measurements of G1 and S/G2 phase lengths and fates of AU565 cells in control condition and drug-treated trials. The experiment was conducted for 96 hours and cells were imaged every 30 minutes and tracked over time. Gemcitabine and lapatinib treatment data with lineages more than 5 cells were imported and fitted to the model. We calculated the AIC metric for several concentrations of each drug, separately. The AIC values for all conditions of a drug were accumulated assuming the influence of a specific drug treatment in terms of the number of pheotypic states of its target population is not concentration-dependent. Fig. @fig:expAIC depicts the most likely number of states that the model finds using AIC metric for lapatinib (Fig. @fig:expAIC a) and gemcitabine (Fig. @fig:expAIC b). From distribution analysis of the phase lengths, we realized the shape parameter of the gamma distribution remains fairly constant over different conditions while the scale paramter changes. Moreover, the transition and initial probability matrix barely changes across different concentration, too. To decrease the degrees of freedom on the model, we estimated them from the control conditions and kept them constant across the fits. This way, instead of $ k \times (k - 1) + (k - 1) + k \times (m) $ degrees of freedom, we will have $4 \times k$ where $k$ is the number of states and $m$ is the number of parameters associated with observation distribution.

<!-- Calculating the number of parameters. -->
<!-- The AIC essentially is the likelihood of the model according to the data, penalized by a scale of the number of parameters that the model has to estimate. Our model estimate a $k \times 1$ initial probability matrix, a $k \times k$ transition matrix, and a $k \times m$ matrix of state-wise parameters where $k$ is the number of states and $m$ is the number of parameters associated with observation distribution. For our phase-specific observation sets we have a total of 6 parameters including 2 bernoulli parameters, and 2 pairs of shape and scale parameters for gamma distribution. Since the row-sums for transition and initial probability matrices must be 1, these values are not independent, hence, we need to calculate the degree of freedom as:  
degree of freedom = $ k \times (k - 1) + (k - 1) + k \times (m) $.  
Given the assumption of constant shape parameters, the total number of parameters that are included in calculating the degrees of freedom becomes 6 - 2 = 4. In addition to estimating transition and initial probability matrices according to the control condition, the degree of freedom for this setting becomes $4 \times k$. -->
