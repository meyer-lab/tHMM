### Lineage information provides unique information about the source and dynamics of heterogeneity

To illustrate the unique value of lineage measurements when analyzing heterogeneous drug responses, we plotted a series of lineages from our measurements of the breast cancer cell line AU565 treated with gemcitabine (Fig. @fig:lineage). While there is a striking difference in the growth dynamics of individual cells, the total number of cells at any given time is nearly identical. As a result, population-level drug response measurements cannot distinguish these differences (CITE). Measurements that record the history of cells (e.g., CFSE staining, Luria-Delbruck experiment) can help to distinguish these two populations but must make assumptions about the dynamics of heterogeneity [@DOI:10.1073/pnas.1715639115; @PMID:28607484]. Lineage measurements, by contrast, provide sufficiently rich measurements to quantify the specific structure of heterogeneous response. By observing individual cells, a variety of phenotypic measurements such as inter-mitotic times, cell cycle phase durations, motility, cell death and division, morphology, and protein and transcription factor levels can be characterized in parallel (CITE).

Each line indicates the lifetime of one cell. The line branching into two lines indicates cell division. Both conditions have the same initial and final number of cells. However, the contribution of individual cells to population growth is clearly different.](figure1.svg){#fig:lineage}

### A lineage tree-based hidden Markov model infers the state of cells given measurements on lineage trees

Given the unique insights that single-cell measurements on lineage trees can provide, we wished to implement a strategy for classifying cells based on their phenotype and relationships. Given a set of measurements made across a lineage tree, we used a lineage tree-based hidden Markov model (tHMM) to fit these data (Fig. {@fig:tree}a). Like a typical hidden Markov model, a tHMM can infer the hidden discrete states of cells given a series of measurements. This takes place using an iterative strategy wherein the states of each cell are predicted given their phenotype and relatives (“expectation” step), and then each distribution of phenotypes is fit to match the cells within that state (“maximization” step) (Fig. {@fig:tree}b). This expectation-maximization (EM) process repeats until convergence.

After fitting, the model can provide a variety of information (Fig. {@fig:tree}c). First, it estimates the starting abundance of each state and the transition probabilities between them. Second, the phenotypes of cells in each state are estimated and can be compared to distinguish how cells of each state behave. The state of each cell can be predicted from the fit data or new measurements. Finally, the model provides a likelihood of each cell’s observations and therefore the data overall. This last quantity can be used, for example, to estimate the number of distinguishable cell states. When implementing these processes, we ensured that a cell’s measurements are defined through a modular interface, allowing other forms of data to be easily integrated.

![**The tHMM interface.** (a) Input data takes the form of single-cell measurements, where the lineage relationship between cells is known. (b) The fitting process includes expectation and maximization steps, where model parameters are iteratively updated until convergence. (c) Output predictions of the model after fitting including the tree of inferred cell states, probabilities of transition between each state, starting abundance of each cell state, and distributions that describe the behavior of cells within each state. The model likelihood can be used to estimate the number of distinguishable cell states.](figure2.svg){#fig:tree}

### Experiments of finite time necessitate experimental censorship corrections

Modeling cell growth and therefore the duration of each cell’s lifetime is complicated by the influence of experimental factors. Specifically, cells at the beginning or end of an experiment persist beyond its duration and so, while we observe them, we do not know the duration of their cell cycle phases. Previously, this has been addressed by simply removing incompletely-observed cells [@doi:10.7554/eLife.51002]. However, doing so results in a systematic bias, where longer-lived cells are preferentially eliminated. On the other hand, treating these truncated values like they were not truncated also creates a systematic bias; for example, the experiment duration would become an upper bound on the cells' lifetimes.

To incorporate this effect into our model, we marked cells or their specific cell cycle phase that encountered the bounds of the experiment as such. When estimating the properties of a cell’s lifetime or the probability of a cell’s observation, these cells instead used a censored estimator or the survival function of the distribution (CITE). Using synthetic data, we verified that this correction resulted in accurate phenotype estimations (Fig. @fig:censor). As exhibited, using the censored estimator as opposed to the uncensored model on incompletely-observed cells results in higher cell state assignment accuracy. Thus, taking into account the cells that outlive the bounds of the experiment through a censored model ensures that we can accurately infer cell states despite the contribution of experiment duration.

### Synthetic lineage benchmarks show a tHMM can accurately estimate population behavior

To evaluate how accurately a tHMM model could infer the behavior of multi-state cell populations, we used synthetic populations of cells in a wide variety of configurations. In each case, we determined that our implementation of a tHMM model could accurately infer the hidden states and parameters of a population given roughly 100 cells. This synthetic data included situations that were both not censored (Figs. @fig:uncenSingle, @fig:uncenMulti, @fig:performUncenSingle, @fig:performUncenMulti) and censored due to cell death and experimental duration to be a valid representative of experimental lineages (Figs. @fig:performSyn, @fig:performCenMulti, @fig:cenMulti). In addition to varying the number of cells in a population, we benchmarked populations with varied cell state percentages (Figs. @fig:prop4, @fig:real_5) and varied degrees of phenotypic differences (Figs. @fig:wass1, @fig:wass2, @fig:wass). In total, this benchmarking showed that our tHMM model would provide accurate results across a range of circumstances.

More specifically, one of the benchmarking studies we performed was with data matching our measurements of AU565, where G1 and S/G2 phase periods were quantified (Fig. {@fig:performSyn}a). Although the tHMM model was fit with no information about the true underlying parameters of the simulated cells, it accurately distinguished the two underlying cell states' phenotypes (Fig. {@fig:performSyn}b–d) and member cells (Fig. {@fig:performSyn}e). On the population level, the transition and starting probabilities were accurately estimated (Fig. {@fig:performSyn}f–g). Thus, we are confident that, with similar experimental data, we should derive accurate results.

![**Model performance on censored lineages of increasing breadth and depth.** (a) Two-state populations of increasing breadth (increasing number of initial cells and therefore lineages) and of increasing depth (increasing experiment time) are analyzed. The states are shown in green and blue colors and red shows cell death. The model performance is shown based on (b) state assignment accuracy, (c) the error between the estimated and the true transition rate matrix and the (d) initial probability vector. Note that the Wasserstein distance between the true and estimated distributions for each state is much lower than the distance for two distributions that are quite similar (Fig. {@fig:wass}b). In (e-f) it shows the accuracy in estimating the Bernoulli parameters for G1 and S/G2 phase, respectively, and (g) depicts the distance between the true and estimated Gamma distributions associated with phase lengths for the two states.

### Lineage information improves cell state identification for heritable phenotypes

Cells of even very distinct molecular states can have partly overlapping phenotypes due to non-heritable variation. Therefore, we sought to evaluate how different two states would need to be for us to accurately identify them as distinct (Fig. {@fig:wass}a). We varied the G1 phase duration of two states from identical to very distinct (Fig. {@fig:wass}b) and quantified the accuracy of our model. While the phenotypic observation of a given state had to be different for our model to accurately assign cells, even partly overlapping phenotypes could be distinguished by using the lineage relationships of cells (Fig. {@fig:wass}c). As a baseline comparison, we used K-means clustering to cluster cells based on their phenotype without using their lineage relationships (Fig. {@fig:wass}c). A tHMM consistently out-performed this approach.  The model performance in censored and uncensored populations were similar (Fig. @fig:wass1, @fig:wass2). This shows that the heritability of a cell state can help to more accurately identify cells with partially overlapping phenotypes.

On the left, cells might be virtually indistinguishable (here based on shape). On the right, they might be so different that looking at one cell is sufficient to identify its state. (b) The distribution of G1 duration is varied in state 1 (blue) while the other state is kept constant. (c) State assignment accuracy versus the Wasserstein distance between state phenotypes. Each point represents the accuracy of state assignment for a lineage created by a set of parameters that yield the shown Wasserstein distance between the two state distributions. Either a k-means model was used with the phenotypes of each individual cell (orange) or the full tHMM model was applied (blue). The solid lines show a Lowess trendline of the model accuracy.](figure6.svg){#fig:wass}

### Likelihood-based model selection can effectively identify the number of distinct states

One does not usually know the number of distinct cell states within a population. Further, the number of distinct states may depend on the environmental context of the cells, particularly because we use phenotypic measurements (CITE). To test whether we could infer the number of phenotypically-distinct states, we performed model selection using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) while varying the number of states (Fig. @fig:sAIC). The predicted number of cell states was predominantly correct, and incorrect predictions still centered around the true answer, for both uncensored and censored lineages (Fig. @fig:sAIC). This indicated that model selection can help to identify the appropriate number of cell states for a given set of measurements.

### tHMM infers multiple distinct subpopulations in experimental drug response data

We used phenotypic measurements of the G1 and S/G2 phase durations and fates in AU565 cells upon gemcitabine and lapatinib treatment as an application of our model. Cells were imaged every 30 minutes for 96 hours and then tracked over time to assemble their lineage relationships. First, we determined the number of distinct states the model inferred within these populations.The model was fit to the drug treatment data across all conditions, holding the initial and transition probabilities constant across concentration but allowing the phenotype emissions to independently vary in each condition. Using the Akeike information criterion as a model selection metric, the tHMM model inferred different numbers of distinct states for each drug (Fig. {@fig:expAIC}a-b).

![**AIC-based model selection infers the likely number of phenotypically distinct subpopulations.** Normalized AIC values for lapatinib- (a) and gemcitabine-treated (b) cells. For both drugs the AIC metric was subtracted by the minimum value observed so that the most likely number of distinct states has an AIC metric equal to 0.](figure9.svg){#fig:expAIC}

### tHMM infers fairly stable subpopulations for lapatinib-treated data

To visualize the properties of the states that the model has identified, we plotted the distribution of average phase-specific time duration for each state and each condition. Figs. {@fig:emissionsLPT}a-d accompanied with the transition probability plot (Fig. {@fig:emissionsLPT}i) show that treatment with lapatinib leads to three fairly stable states. As expected, lapatinib mostly influences G1 phase where it extend the duration of this phase in all states (Fig. {@fig:emissionsLPT}e) and leaves G2 progression rates almost unchanged (Fig. {@fig:emissionsLPT}f). This fact could be also observed in Figs. {@fig:emissionsLPT}a-d where green scatters that show cells in G1 phase, cover a wider range and could be as long as 120 hours and more, but G2 phase lengths are mosly condensed centered at ~30-50 hours long. Figs. {@fig:emissionsLPT}g-h show that mostly G1 cell death happens in state 2 and 3, but death in G2 phase is observed as well, in state 1.

### Gemcitabine treatment leaves stable and cycle states in the cell population

Increasing the concentration in gemcitabine-treated trials shows a trend of extension and cell death in both phases, especially in G2 (Figs. {@fig:emissionsGMC}a-d). Figs. {@fig:emissionsGMC}e-f show that phase progression in G1 is only evident when the concentration is very high, but cells in all three states have a decline in their G2 progression rate for every concentration. Division probability is shown in Figs. {@fig:emissionsGMC}g-h where we see G1 cell death more significantly in state 1, and G2 cell death in state 2 and 3. From the transition graph (Fig. {@fig:emissionsGMC}i) states 2 and 3 form a cycle while state 1 is fairly stable. Cells in state 1 seem to be slower in G1 progression in any concentration, and have higher G1 cell death probability in the highest concentration. On the other hand, although cells in state 3 have higher probability of cell in G2, but due to the high inward transition probability from state 2, they are not depleted in G2.
