### Identifying heterogeneity in cell populations

[//]: # (Figure 1)

As a motivating example, we present two cases of cell population growth over time, one where the population is relatively homogeneous and all cells show consistent behaviour across their observed phenotypes, and one where the population can be clustered into at least two subpopulations, each with different growth rates. Over time, the two populations look similar, with regards to usual methods of analysis, such as TODO. These methods fail to capture the heterogeneity in the second population, and assumptions made from these results would be incomplete. However, utilizing the tHMM model we have built, we are not only able to capture the heterogeneity present in the two different populations, but also quantify the relative presence of these two states, and summarize the characteristics of the observed phenotypes.

### Modeling lineages based on heritable phenotypes

[//]: # (Figure 2)

Because the goal of our model is to identify states, we have packaged with our model a light-weight framework for developing and using states. TODO **Add some introduction to the history of states, their various defintions and applications across cell biology, systems biology, phylogeny, and bioengineering** We define states as multivariate probabilistic distributions, which in turn, are defined by the set of parameters that describe those very distributions. The observed phenotypes for cells in a lineage tree can be viewed as realizations of these multivariate probabilistic distributions. As a simple example, we can consider only observing the end fate of a cell. Interpreting this as a random variable, the fate of a cell can be represented as the outcome of a Bernoulli random trial: if a cell lives and divides, then the random variable is 1 and if a cell dies, then the random variable is 0. For each cell, the observed phenotype of its fate, either 1 or 0, can be seen as a sampling of the state it belongs to. The Bernoulli probability distribution is parameterized by a single rate parameter which describes the rate at which 1 is more likely than 0  as the outcome of a random trial. In this simple scenario, each state is another Bernoulli probability distribution, defined by its unique rate parameter. Ultimately, the goal of our model is to identify an optimal number of states, identify which cells belong to which states, and have the states represent the observed phenotypes of the cells in that state. Continuing the same example, if the model were to look for two states in a given cell population, then it might define the cells that divide more often into the first state, and the other set of cells that die more often into a second state. Because each state in this example is a Bernoulli probability distribution that describes the observed phenotypes of the cells that belong to that state, the first state will have a Bernoulli parameter that is larger than that of the second state. In the case that we present, we observe the intermitotic times of the cell spent in both G1 and G2, as well as the fate observed at the end of each of those phases. As before, the fates can be operationalized as Bernoulli random variables, where a random variable of 1 for the end of G1 fate represents a transition into G2, and a 0 would represent death, and likewise, a random variable of 1 for the end of G2 fate represents division, and a 0 would represent death. Furthermore, to represent the time spent in the G1 and G2 phases, we use two gamma random variables, each parameterized by a pair of shape and scale parameters. Note that if a cell were to die in G1, no information about G2 will be known or observed. Additionally, if cell lived past a desired experiment time then, the full observation of its time spent in whatever phase it was in will also be incomplete. These are two of the many cases of censorship that affect data collection as well as how the model analyses the data, and is discussed in greater detail later on. In the previous simple case, states were simply different Bernoulli distributions with unique rate parameters. In our case, states are multivariate and are composed of two Bernoulli distributions and two gamma distributions. These states are described by six parameters in total, two Bernoulli rate parameters and two pairs of gamma shape and scale parameters. In general, any obbservable heritable phenotype that can be operationalized into a probabilistic distribution can be used to represent a state. Some examples include using a Gaussian distributed random variable to describe average cell motility, parameterized by its mean and variance. One state might describe cells that move faster while other states might describe cells that move slower. This example can be extended to include Gaussian random variables for both cell velocity and acceleration to describe cell kinematics in general. 

Computationally, these states are user-defined classes instantiated by the parameters that describe them. Fundamentally, if a state is to be used to analyze data collected from single-cell lineage experiments, then a state needs to include a list of parameters, a probability distribution function that takes in a tuple of observations and a list of distribution parameters and returns a likelihood, and an maximum likelihood estimator that can take in tuples of observations and return a list of parameter estimates. If one were to use their definition of a state to create computational synthetic lineages of cells, then the user would also have to provide a random variable function that takes in a list of distribution parameters of inputs, and outputs a tuple of realizations, which would be synthetic observations of cells.

### Biases in experimental data collection

Censorship is an important things to consider when collecting single cell lineage data. **Figure 3** presents our model's performance on synthetic lineage data which is both uncensored and censored over populations with an increasing number of lineages. 

![**Model performance on censored and uncensored data.** Two populations with the same parameters, one uncensored, the other censored are created. (a) Representative lineages from each of the two types of populations are drwan to highlight visually the stark difference in data size that would be input to the model when considering experimental data which would be censored. In these synthetic computational lineages, censorship occurs when a cell dies (and its lineage ends) or when it lives past an experiment time. (b) The model's performance, based on state assignment accuracy, on these populations as the number of lineages in them increases is presented.](./output/figure3.svg){#fig:3}




### Performance on synthetic lineages 

[//]: # (Figure 4)

Here we show the performance of the model by increasing the cell numbers. The figure shows the state assignment accuracy and parameter estimations for censored lineages.

![**Model performance on censored lineages of increasing breadth and depth.** Two state populations of increasing breadth (increasing number of lineages or initial cells) and of increasing depth (increasing experiment time) are analyzed. Their model performance, as based on state assignment accuracy, the error bewteen the estimated and the true transition rate matrix and the initial probability vector, and the accuracy in estimating the parameters underlying the two state distributions are shown.](./output/figure4.svg){#fig:4}




### Distinguishing phenotypes and states

[//]: # (Figure 5)

Determining a threshold of some quality or characteristic to define "different states" in the context of cell biology is complicated. One can consider a continuous spectrum of a phenotype within a heterogeneous tumor of cells. For example, in a population one can consider infinite states corresponding to the proliferation speed. Moreover, with the assumption of discrete and finite number of states, it is hard to draw a line and separate fast from slow proliferating cells, especially if the difference is slight. To simplify this concept, we consider the cell states to be discrete and finite. In either case, if the phenotype that we are tracing as an emission is more distinct between the states, clustering cells with that phenotype and state assignment associated with cells is easier.  
In order to test the performance of our model given different cases as the states being similar or different, we employed Wasserstein distance metric. In our setup, the emissions include cell fate (in G1 and S/G2), G1 phase duration, and S/G2 phase duration in two states. To represent the difference between states associated with these phenotypes, we kept cell fate and S/G2 duration parameters constant and varied a G1 phase duration parameter across the states. We sweep a space where at the beginning the two states are very similar and they becomre more and more different. The shared parameters associated with the emission between the two states are ($bern_{G_1} = 0.99$, $bern_{G_2} = 0.8$, $shape_{G_1} = 12$, $shape_{G_2} = 10$, $scale_{G_2} = 5$) and the scale parameter of G1 phase for state 1 is being varied in the range of $[1, 2.5]$, while the scale parameter of G1 in state 2 is kept at $1$.  
Figure 4a depicts the similarity and difference between two states in terms of cell shapes. The upper row represents state 1 with a gradual change of states over four stages, while the lower row shows state 2 which is kept the same so that the two states become more and more different over the four stages. Figure 4b presents the distribution of the cells' G1 duration for the two states and that first the two states have all their phenotypes identical, and G1 duration in state 1 changes so they become distinct. In Figure 4c, the accuracy of state assignment is shown where for the case where the two states are the same, Wasserstein distance is approximately zero and as the two states become more distinct the Wasserstein distance gets larger, meaning they are more different. Intuitively, if the states are more distinct, determining single-cells' states is more accurate. As shown in Figure 4c, the model is capable of determining the true states of single-cells when they are almost similar by almost $80%$ accuracy and reaches above $90$ when they are further distinct.

![**Model perfomance relative to the Wasserstein distance between states.** (a) A visual representation of how two states might be defined with regards to cell phenotype: as one cell evolves and changes phenotypically, the state it belongs to becomes more distant from the state the unchanging cell belongs to. This elaborates on how we can interpret having two states in cell populations where similar or different phenotypes are observed. (b) The distribution of a phenotype (namely the time spent in the G1 phase of the cell cycle) is varied in state 1 (blue) while the other state is kept constant. When cells of different states are phenotypically similar, the states themselves have probability distributions that are similar. When cells of different states are phenotypically distinct, the states are defined by distinct probability distributions. (c) The performance of our model, based on accuracy of state assignment, is shown relative to the Wasserstein distance between the two states of the cells in the populations being analyzed.](./output/figure5.svg){#fig:5}




### Sizes of states in populations

[//]: # (Figure 6)

This parts explains how the model performs in the case of an under-represented population of cells.

![**Model performance relative to the presence of each state** (a) A visual representation of how lineages and populations can have different proportions of their total cell population be represented by different states. (b) Populations with different ratios of cells belonging to one state over the other are made. The ratio of the number of cells in state 1 to the number of cells in state 2 increases from 1:10 to 9:10. This is achieved by synthetically creating lineages with transition rates that bias towards making one state over the other. Model performance relative to the presence of that state is shown.](./output/figure6.svg){#fig:6}




### Determining the number of states

[//]: # (Figure 7)

In this part we explain the AIC figures.

![**AIC** (a)-(d) AIC curves are shown for uncensored lineages made with 2 to 4 states. (e)-(h) AIC curves are shown for censored lineages made with 2 to 4 states. The number of states that yeilds the minimal AIC value represents the optimal number of states that can describe the cells in that population. Histograms are shown to count which number of states yield the minimal AIC over a number of analyzed populations.](./output/figure7.svg){#fig:7}
