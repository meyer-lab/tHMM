### Lineage information provides unique information about the source and dynamics of heterogeneity

To illustrate the unique value of lineage measurements when analyzing heterogeneous drug responses, we plotted a series of lineages from our measurements of the breast cancer cell line AU565 treated with gemcitabine (Fig. @fig:lineage). If we consider these to be two different, hypothetical populations, there is a striking difference in which cells contribute to the population’s growth but the starting and ending cell numbers are nearly identical. As a result, endpoint, population-level drug response measurements cannot distinguish these population structures. Measurements that record the history of cells (e.g., CFSE staining, Luria-Delbruck experiment) can help to distinguish these two populations but make assumptions about the dynamics of heterogeneity [@DOI:10.1073/pnas.1715639115; @PMID:28607484]. Lineage measurements, by contrast, provide sufficiently rich measurements to accurately quantify the extent and dynamics of heterogeneity. By observing individual cells, a variety of phenotypic measurements such as inter-mitotic times, cell cycle phase durations, motility, cell death and division, morphology, and protein and transcription factor levels can be characterized in parallel.

### A tHMM infers the state of cells given measurements on lineage trees

Given the unique insights that single-cell measurements on lineage trees can provide, we wished to implement a strategy for classifying cells based on their phenotype and relationships. Given a set of measurements made across a lineage tree, we used a lineage tree-based hidden Markov model (tHMM) to fit these data (Fig. {@fig:tree}a). Just like a typical hidden Markov model, a tHMM can infer the hidden discrete states of cells given a series of measurements. This takes place using an iterative strategy wherein the states of each cell are predicted given distributions that describe the phenotype of cells in each state (“expectation” step), and then each distribution of phenotypes is fit to match the cells within that state (“maximization” step) (Fig. {@fig:tree}b). This expectation-maximization (EM) process repeats until convergence.

After fitting, the tHMM model provides a variety of information (Fig. {@fig:tree}c). First, this process provides an estimate for the starting abundance of each state and the probability of transitions between them. Second, the phenotypes of cells in each state are estimated and can be compared to distinguish how each state behaves. The state of each cell can be predicted from the fit data or new measurements. Finally, the model provides a likelihood of each cell’s observations and therefore the data overall. This last quantity can be used, for example, to estimate the number of cell states with distinguishable behavior. When implementing these processes, we ensured that a cell’s measurements are defined through a modular interface. This allows other forms of data to be easily integrated.

### Experiments of finite time necessitate data censorship corrections

Modeling the duration of each cell’s lifetime is complicated by the influence of experimental factors. Specifically, cells at the beginning or end of an experiment are cut off and so, while we observe them, we do not know the duration of their cell cycle phases. Previously, this has been addressed by simply removing incompletely-observed cells [@doi:10.7554/eLife.51002]. However, doing so results in a systematic bias, where longer-lived cells are preferentially eliminated. On the other hand, treating these truncated values like they were not truncated also creates a systematic bias; for example, it would create an upper bound on the possible cell lifetime.

To incorporate this effect into our model, we marked cells or their specific cell cycle phase that encountered the bounds of the experiment as censored. When estimating the properties of a state’s lifetime or the probability of a cell’s observation these cells instead used a censored estimator or the survival function of the distribution. Using synthetic data, we verified that this correction resulted in accurate phenotype estimations (Fig. @fig:censor). This ensures that we can accurately infer cell states despite this experiment effect.

### Synthetic lineage benchmarks show a tHMM can accurately estimate population behavior

To evaluate how accurately a tHMM model could infer the behavior of multi-state cell populations, we used synthetic populations of cells in a wide variety of configurations. In each case we determined that our implementation of a tHMM model could accurately and without bias infer the hidden states and parameters of a population given roughly 100 cells. This synthetic data included situations that were not censored (Figs. @fig:uncenSingle, @fig:uncenMulti, @fig:performUncenSingle, @fig:performUncenMulti) and censored due to cell death and experimental duration to be a valid representative of experimental linea g:performSyn, @fig:performCenMulti, @fig:cenMulti). In addition to varying the number of cells in a population, we benchmarked populations with varied percentages of cell states (Figs. @fig:prop, @fig:prop4, @fig:real_5) and varied phenotypic differences between the states (Figs. @fig:wass1, @fig:wass2, @fig:wass). In total, this benchmarking showed that our tHMM model would provide accurate results.

More specifically, one of the benchmarking studies we performed was with data matching our measurements of AU565, where G1 and S/G2 phase periods were quantified (Fig. {@fig:performSyn}a). Although the tHMM model was fit with no information about the true underlying parameters of the simulated cells, it accurately distinguished the two underlying cell states phenotypes (Fig. {@fig:performSyn}b–d) and member cells (Fig. {@fig:performSyn}e). On the population level, the transition and starting probabilities were accurately estimated (Fig. {@fig:performSyn}f–g). Thus, we are confident that, with similar experimental data, we should derive accurate results.

### Lineage information improves cell state identification

Cells of even very distinct molecular states can have partly overlapping phenotypes. Therefore, we sought to evaluate how different two states would need to be for us to accurately identify them as distinct (Fig. {@fig:wass}a). We varied the G1 phase duration of two states from identical to very distinct (Fig. {@fig:wass}b) and quantified the accuracy of our model. While the phenotypic observation of a given state had to be different for our model to accurately assign cells, even partly overlapping phenotypes could be distinguished by using the lineage relationships of cells (Fig. {@fig:wass}c). As a baseline comparison, we used k-means clustering to cluster cells based on their phenotype without using their lineage relationships (Fig. {@fig:wass}c). A tHMM consistently out-performed this approach.  The model performance in censored and uncensored populations was similar (Fig. @fig:wass1, @fig:wass2). This shows that the heritability of a cell state can be used to more accurately identify cells with partially overlapping phenotypes.

<!-- ### Rare cell states require greater numbers of cells

To validate our model's capability to identify less common cell states, we created a synthetic populations of 2 states and varied the proportion of cells in these states while keeping the total cell number relatively constant (Fig. {@fig:prop}a). Not surprisingly, the cell state assignment accuracy decreased when a cell state became rare within the population (Fig. {@fig:prop}b–c). Importantly, we used a balanced accuracy metric when quantifying the accuracy of cell state assignment. This means that rare cell states are weighted more heavily in this accuracy calculation. We observed that most incorrect assignments were of the less common cell state. Therefore, these results indicated that one must have multiple measurements of a given cell state to accurately quantify its presence and behavior. However, more abundant states can still be accurately quantified in the presence of rare states with insufficient cells (Fig. @fig:prop4, @fig:real_5). -->
### Likelihood-based model selection can effectively identify the number of distinct states

Usually it is unclear how many distinct cell states may exist within a population. Further, the number of states identified may depend on the environmental context of the cells, particularly because we use phenotypic measurements. To test whether we could determine the number of distinct states, we performed model selection using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and models with varying numbers of states (Fig. @fig:sAIC). The predicted number of cell states was predominantly correct, and incorrect predictions still centered around the true answer, for both uncensored and censored lineages (Fig. @fig:sAIC). This indicates that model selection can help to identify the appropriate number of cell states given a set of measurements.

### tHMM predicts several distinct subpopulations in experimental drug response data

As an application of our model, we employed phenotypic measurements of G1 and S/G2 phase lengths and fates of AU565 cells in control condition and drug-treated trials to find out the number of distinct states the model predicts within these populations. The experiment was conducted for 96 hours and cells were imaged every 30 minutes and tracked over time. Gemcitabine and lapatinib treatment data with lineages were imported and fitted to the model. We calculated the AIC metric for several concentrations of each drug, separately. The AIC values for all conditions of a drug were accumulated assuming the influence of a specific drug treatment in terms of the number of phenotypic states of its target population is not concentration-dependent. Fig. @fig:expAIC depicts the most likely number of states that the model finds using AIC metric for lapatinib and gemcitabine-treated populations (Fig. {@fig:expAIC}a-b).

### Identified subpopulations own unique properties in drug-treated experimental data

Realizing the number of distinct subpopulations in a data is most valuable when it is accompanied with the information about specifications of each subpopulation. To find out what information each state holds and learning about unique properties of each subpopulation, we plotted the observed measurements for each state, separately. The following two sections discuss our findings for lapatinib and gemcitabine-treated data.

#### tHMM infers fairly stable subpopulations for lapatinib-treated data

To visualize the properties of the states that the model has identified, we plotted the distribution of average phase-specific time duration for each state and condition. Figs. {@fig:emissionsLPT}a-d show that treatment with lapatinib leads to three fairly stable states (Fig. @fig:emissionsLPT i) and that infers extension of G1 phase mostly captured in cells of state 1 and 2 where we see cells of state 2 in G1 are almost depleted. As expected, lapatinib only affects G1 phase and leaves a very slight influence on G2 phase.

#### Gemcitabine treatment leaves stables and cycle states in the cell population

Gemcitabine treatment shown in Figs. {@fig:emissionsGMC}a-d) concludes G2 phase extension as a result of increasing the concentration seen in all states. There appears to be two stable states and two cycles (Fig. @fig:emissionsGMC) i. With higher concentrations, cells of all states spend less time in G1 and cell death is the dominant fate in state 0 and 1.
