.. py:function:: import_AU565(path)

   Importing AU565 file cells.
   :param path: the path to the file.
   :return population: list of cells structured in CellVar objects.


.. py:function:: assign_observs_AU565(cell, lineage, uniq_id)

   Given a cell, the lineage, and the unique id of the cell, it assigns the observations of that cell, and returns it.
   :param cell: a CellVar object to be assigned observations.
   :param lineage: the lineage list of cells that the given cell is from.
   :param uniq_id: the id given to the cell from the experiment.


.. py:function:: import_MCF10A(path)

   Reading the data and extracting lineages and assigning their corresponding observations.
   :param path: the path to the mcf10a data.
   :return population: list of cells structured in CellVar objects.


.. py:function:: assign_observs_MCF10A(cell, lineage, uniq_id)

   Given a cell, the lineage, and the unique id of the cell, it assigns the observations of that cell, and returns it.
   :param cell: a CellVar object to be assigned observations.
   :param lineage: the lineage list of cells that the given cell is from.
   :param uniq_id: the id given to the cell from the experiment.


.. py:function:: MCF10A(condition)

   Creates the population of lineages for each condition.
   Conditions include: PBS, EGF-treated, HGF-treated, OSM-treated.
   :param condition: a condition between [PBS, EGF, HGF, OSM]
