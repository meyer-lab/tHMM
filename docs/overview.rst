We present `tHMM`, a Python3 library for exploring heterogeneity in lineage tree data.
`tHMM` leverages the well-known principles of hidden Markov models and is adjusted to work with lineage tree data.
`tHMM` performs clustering based on specific measurements of individuals and relations among them
for improved specificity in pinpointing the structure and dynamics of heterogeneity focused on the measured phenotypes.
